# Collection System

This collection system was implemented by us to remove any chnaces of p2w. In the collection ystem, you will have to gain a certain amount of a material in order to gain the ability to use them. Every season we will most likely add items to this collection system. This is the only part of the server which doesn't restart after a new season, so you would.t have to grind all the time.

## Pets

The only way to get pets is by reaching these collections. You cannot craft or give them to other people.
