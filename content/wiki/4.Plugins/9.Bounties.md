# Bounties

With our bounties plugin, you can give, set or add anyone bounties. This money reward will be given to the person who kills the ones with the bounty. It can only be claimed at spain, in the arena or the warzone.
- People who have a bounty over 10,000 will have a special hologram above their name
- There is a bounty board at spawn with the top 9 bounties server-wide

### Commands

- /bounty
With this command, you can see all the bounties, and on the bottom right, you can decide to set a bounty to everyone by clicking the skeleton skull
